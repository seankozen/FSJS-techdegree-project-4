# Phrase Hunter Game
The following stylistic changes were made:
1. The main font was changed to the Google font, Bangers.
2. When a guessed letter is correct and revealed, as the letter fades in, the tile spins 360 degrees.  Also, a black border inside the tile was added.
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based on mockup images.
## How to navigate this project
- App can be accessed through the index.html file.
- Responsive styling with CSS.
## Why I built the project this way
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, but this project focuses on the
  frontend. That's why an array was used to store the phrases.  Another purpose was to implement object-oriented programming.
## If I had more time I would change this
- Connect to a database to retrieve phrases from a larger selection.
